I. Introduction
This manual provides instructions on how to apply toothpaste onto a toothbrush. It is an essential step for proper oral hygiene. Please refer to the instructions and figures below to complete this procedure.

II. Prerequisites
In order to begin applying toothpaste onto a toothbrush, the following conditions must be met:

1. Obtain a toothbrush and a toothpaste.

Toothbrushes and toothpastes can be purchased at supermarkets (usually found in the cosmetics aisle), pharmacies or online. For a visual reference, see Figures 1 and 2.

2. Open the outer packaging and retrieve the toothbrush.

3. Repeat for the toothpaste.

III. Instructions
Follow the steps below to apply toothpaste onto a toothbrush.

Grab the toothpaste container (Figure 3) by the tube with one hand.

Grab the cap with the other hand and twist it counterclockwise to open the container.

If the toothpaste container is new, it might include a tamper seal on the tube tip. If this applies to your toothpaste container, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions on the packaging to remove the seal before continuing.

1. Put away the cap.

2. Grab the toothbrush (Figure 4) by the handle.

3. Align the tube tip of the toothpaste container with the bristles of the toothbrush.

4. Gently squeeze the tube until a drop of toothpaste about the size of a pea is extracted through the tube tip onto the bristles of the toothbrush.

Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. It is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food residue from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients to help prevent tooth decay and gum disease.

5. Close the tube by twisting the cap clockwise onto the tube tip.
